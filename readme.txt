Welcome, 

With this code you can visualize the song data from all public playlists on Spotify. 


This project contains no raw data. 
Instead, data is requested from Spotify upon running the code, and transformed into a dataframe using the modules I wrote ("modules.py"). 
The "setup.py" file is needed to import all modules in the notebook without looking ugly, and for authentication to use the Spotify Web API. 

***** INSTRUCTIONS *****
In order to run this project, make sure the following files are saved in the same folder: 
- "Project_Final_Ruben.ipynb"
- "modules.py"
- "setup.py"

You must also have a working internet connection. 

Now, open "Project_Final_Ruben.ipynb" in jupyter notebook and run all cells
This is done by typing the following in the console: 
$ jupyter notebook 

Make sure you have your directory set to the folder that contains all necessary files. 
The notebook file is self-explanatory and the graph should be easy to navigate. 

I hope you enjoy!
